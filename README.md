Welcome to project GENESIS.
=============================

This piece of software is currently under development and will increase in size, quality and functionality!

We are team JAMES, which is an acronym for our names. But what's more important is what we are developing:
A piece of software that will enable biologists, or actually everyone, to design and simulate protein chain models. 
So now you can design your own micro-processes using proteins!
