Welcome to project GENESIS.

this piece of software is currently under development and wil increase in size, quality and functionality!

We are team JAMES, which is an acronym for our names. But what's more important is what we are developing:
A piece of software that wil enable biologists, or actually everyone, to design en simulate proteine chain models. 
So now you can design your own micro-processes using proteins!
